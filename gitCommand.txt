gitignore ways to ignore
->|filename|.|extension| - just mentioning the name and extension makes git ignore the file for any changes.
->*.|extension| - git ignores all file with corresponding extension.
->|foldername|/ - mentioning the folder name in this way makes git ignore all the directory with the corresponding name and its content.
->adding a '/' before folder name makes it so that folder present in the root directory with the corresponding name gets ignored and not all the directory with the same name.
