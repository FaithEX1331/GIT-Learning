This is a repository created during my git learning period.
This repo contains a lot of meaningless files that do not serve any actual purpose.
These files were used in learning how to implement the various git commands.
The two files gitCommand.txt and steps to connect to git hub.txt are important files containing important basic commands and steps to host a local repo into a remote.
